            Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers
            to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app.
            Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among 
            alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing 
            at different e-retailers. As of 2020, customers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices, 
            including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.

            An online shop evokes the physical analogy of buying products or services at a regular "bricks-and-mortar" 
            retailer or shopping center; the process is called business-to-consumer (B2C) online shopping. When an online 
            store is set up to enable businesses to buy from another businesses, the process is called business-to-business 
            (B2B) online shopping. A typical online store enables the customer to browse the firm's range of products and 
            services, view photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, 
            features and prices.
